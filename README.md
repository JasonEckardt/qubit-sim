# Qubit Simulator

A Python-based qubit simulator for simulating quantum states and operations in quantum computing. This project allows users to simulate qubits, apply quantum gates, and visualize the outcomes of various quantum operations.

## Features

- Simulate single and multiple qubits.
- Apply quantum gates (e.g., Hadamard, Pauli-X, Pauli-Y, Pauli-Z).
- Perform quantum measurements.
- Visualize qubit states and operations.
- Simulate Grover's Algorithm
